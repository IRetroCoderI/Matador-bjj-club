        <h1>Paying your Membership</h1>
        <p>Total Membership cost: $160 per semester</p>
        <p>For the first two weeks of training (9/9 - 9/18), there is a weekly trial fee of $20 ($40 for both).</p>
        <p>If you decide to stay and join the team (given you have already completed the required paperwork), we take off your fees from the total cost, so all you have to do is pay the remainder!</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>Pay Cash, in person to one of our officers.</p>
                <ul><li>There could be a wait time if multiple students are ahead of you, not recommended since it can hold up training time.</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li><p>Pay Online, through our cashnet portal. (Recommended)</p>
                <ul><li>Pay with card. Fast, on your own time, forward receipt to <a href="mailto:jiujitsu@csunas.org">jiujitsu@csunas.org</a></li></ul>
