        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <p>If you are brand new to the gentle art of Jiu-Jitsu, and would like to join our club, you can start here!</p>

        <h2>Why Join?</h2>
        <p>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is quickly growing as the most popular martial art in the world, due to its practicality and effectiveness as a self-defense sport. </p>
        <p>BJJ is a grappling martial art that emphasizes leverage and technique to achieve control, with the goal of submitting an opponent. Beyond this, BJJ offers physical benefits, mental resillience, stress relief, and a strong, friendly community! </p>
        <p>
            Self-defense: BJJ training prepares you for real-world scenarios, as a majority of altercations end up on the ground. Our sparring sessions, or "rolls" provide realistic and beneficial results, through muscle memory and practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Physical benefits: BJJ engages all major muscle groups, and will help improve cardiovascular health, strength, and flexibility. Not only is BJJ excellent cardio that can be used to aid fitness goals, the dynamic movements and techniques help enhance coordination, balance, and mobility!
        </p>
        <p>
            Mental Benefits: The physical activity and focus required in BJJ has shown reduction in stress, and improve mood. As you learn and progress on the mats, you will feel your confidence and self-esteem rise. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Above all, the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu community, especially the CSUN Club, is a supportive and welcoming program that fosters friendships, creates a sense of belonging, and will give you something to look forward to after a long day of studying!
        </p>
